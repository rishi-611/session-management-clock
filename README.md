A time management clock to manage your sessions and breaks.

Set your Session and break time lengths, and start the timer.

The app will notify you when you session is over and then, it will automatically start the timer for your break. The app will then notify you again when your break time is over

The clock can be paused or reset at any time. Also, you can check the time left for your session/break at any time.

The default session length is 25 minutes, while the default break length is 5 minutes.
